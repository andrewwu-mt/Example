This package has the specific generator and stream item for the Market Maker domain.

<p><b>MarketMaker Response Data</b></p>
 
Unique MarketMakers(key) are generated by using a random, four-character string.
Each Market Maker works a BID and ASK order.
The source of the market maker and market maker identifier 
are initially generated randomly and stay constant throughout program execution.
The prices and order sizes for both ASK and BID are chosen randomly as well as the action (update, add, or delete).
The time of the order is the time at which the response data was created.
