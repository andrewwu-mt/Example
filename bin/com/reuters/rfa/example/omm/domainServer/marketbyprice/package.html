This package has the specific generator and stream item for the Market By Price domain.

<p><b>MarketByPrice Response Data</b></p>
 
Unique prices(key) are generated during each iteration by decrementing and incrementing the base price randomly generated 
in the first round of iteration. The key is generated by appending a <b>
<font face="Courier" size="2">B</font></b> to the price for BID prices, and by appending an
<b><font face="Courier" size="2">S</font></b> to the price for ASK prices
The unique price, side (BID or ASK), aggregated size of orders, total number of orders, and action (update, add, or delete) are chosen 
randomly during message updates to generate more realistic data.
The time of the order is the time at which the response data is created.
