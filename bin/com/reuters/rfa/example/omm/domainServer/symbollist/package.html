This package has the specific generator and stream item for the Symbol List domain.

<p><b>SymbolList Response Data</b></p>
 
A unique symbol(key) is generated by using a random, five-character string.
The value of the original provider symbol name (PROV_SYMB) of each MapEntry is 
the same as the symbol key for that entry.
Permissions (PROD_PERM) are generated by using the specified value.
The action is generated randomly (update, add, or delete).
Each refresh includes up to 150 Map entries. 
By default, <b>DataDefinitions</b> are used to reduce bandwidth.
The <b>TotalCountHint</b> is not provided. 
The <b><font size="2" face="Courier New">Map.KeyFieldId</font></b> is currently not set.
