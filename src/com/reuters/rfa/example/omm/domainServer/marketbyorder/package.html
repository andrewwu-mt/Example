This package has the specific generator and stream item for the Market By Order domain.

<p><b>MarketByOrder Response Data</b></p>
 
Unique orders(key) are generated by monitoring the total of all added entries, which sets the value of the key.
The price, side of the order, quantity of the order, market maker, and action (update, add, or delete) 
are chosen randomly during message updates to generate more realistic data.
The time of the order is the time at which the response data was created.
